## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental to understanding and solving computational problems efficiently. This repository is aimed at documenting my progress and providing a structured path for anyone interested in learning DSA using C and C++.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this repository, you should have a basic understanding of:
- C programming language
- Basic C++ syntax (optional)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KayVeeZ/DSA_practice.git
   cd DSA_practice
   ```
2. **Set up your environment**

    - Ensure you have GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed for compiling C programs.
    - Optionally, have a C++ compiler set up for any C++ code you may encounter.

3. **Compile and run a sample program**

   ```sh
   gcc -o hello-world hello-world.c
   ./hello-world
   ```

## Structure of the Repository
The repository is organized as follows:

```sh
dsa_Practice/
├── arrays/
│   ├── array_basics.c
│   └── dynamic_array.c
├── linked-lists/
│   ├── singly_linked_list.c
│   └── doubly_linked_list.c
├── stacks/
│   └── stack_using_array.c
├── queues/
│   └── queue_using_linked_list.c
├── sorting-algorithms/
│   ├── bubble_sort.c
│   └── quick_sort.c
└── README.md
```

Each directory contains code examples and exercises for different data structures and algorithms.
